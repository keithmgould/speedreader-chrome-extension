# Speed Reader Chrome Extension
Most (80%) of your reading time is used to physically move your eyeballs.  This Chrome extension takes your block of selected text and presents it to you one word at a time.  This eliminates eye movement, drastically speeding up your reading time.

## How To Use
0. Install the Extension
1. Select a block of text you want to read quickly.
2. Click the eye icon, which appears to the right of the omnibox
3. Optionally change the speed.
4. Click Start.

## Special Thanks
I saw this [this JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/vKZLn/1/ "Fiddle") with most of the work done.  From there I enhanced the UI a bit, and wrapped it in a Chrome extension.
